{"name":"Osgi-utils","body":"#OSGi Utilities\r\n\r\n##The Goal\r\n\r\nNowadays I'm working a lot with OSGi, more precisally with Equinox. And I'm using two tools to build my projects: Eclipse Tycho for manifes-first projects and Maven Bundle Plugin for pom-first projects. \r\n\r\nIt is not possible to build both types of project same time using Tycho. It must be done in two steps always. \r\n\r\nSo, to help me, I've decided to create one P2 Repository and concentrate there the most important bundles that I'm using, grouped by features, including those that are already OSGi and those that was OSGified (by maven-bundle-plugin).\r\n\r\nThis way all other projects can be setup using a Target Platform Definition file pointing to the P2 and I can only use Tycho for the entire building.\r\n\r\nThe P2 has two categories: \r\n\r\n**OSGi Utils**, that contains utilities made by myself or that was based in somebody work; \r\n\r\n**Dependencies**, that is basically a repackaging of already existent bundles or OSGified ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Building the P2 Repository\r\n\r\nThis build will create a P2 repository at directory \"OSGi-Utils/com.c4biz.osgiutils.p2/target/repository\" that contains all features needed by EPF to be installed as plugins.\r\n\r\n### Using an OS terminal console\r\n\r\n1) Clone the repository\r\n\r\n \tgit clone git@github.com:cvgaviao/OSGi-Utils.git       \r\n\r\n2) Go to the OSGi-Utils parent directory and call the maven command\r\n\r\n\tcd OSGi-Utils/\r\n\tmvn clean verify -P p2-all \r\n\r\n### Using Eclipse IDE Launcher\r\n\r\nIf you want you can import the projects into Eclipse and build them using the supplied launcher. You must ensure that you have installed the latest m2e plugin and its tycho add-on.\r\n\r\n1) Import the project using 'Existing Maven Projects' \r\n\r\n2) Go to 'Run Configurations' and select \"OSGi Utilities - P2\".\r\n\r\n### Accessing the generated P2 repository\r\n\r\n- You must add this address in your Target Platform Definition: http://cvgaviao.github.com/osgi-utils/p2/juno","tagline":"A set of eclipse features that wraps common bundles to be installed in Target Platform using P2.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
